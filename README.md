<b> Basic Calculator using C# </b>

Finding issues with launching application file, application window flashes then closes immediately, resolved from home desktop by changing Concole.ReadLine(); to Console.ReadKey(); but exe still won't launch if downloaded via GitHub, still troubleshooting this issue.

Feel free to copy and paste source code into local IDE to run, works fine in Visual Studio and VS Code.
